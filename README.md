# vJoy
The only purpose of this branch, is to make the io4 playable natively, using BRUNNER's vJoy, since it's the only Win11 version vJoy version around there.

App has not been signed nor anything else, only a small cpp has been altered in SDK folder that can make the io4 steering wheel and pedals work.
FFB via software might be possible without the need of an extra arduino, but there's still a long way to go before.
